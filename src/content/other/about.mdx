Hey there — I’m **Nithin Athrapulikkal (AP)** 👋

I’m a Software Engineer who loves turning complex data challenges into elegant, scalable systems. With over a decade of experience, I’ve built data-intensive, distributed, and cloud-native platforms designed for high throughput and scalability.

Currently, I’m part of **Amazon’s Advertising Tech team**, where I design large-scale data processing systems for ads-measurement and privacy-first analytics systems that power insights across billions of ad events daily.
Before that, I built real-time streaming frameworks and AI-powered analytics tools at Alphonso (now LG Ads), Yodlee, Goldman Sachs and Infosys.

### 🧠 My Tech Stack

* **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS/Fargate, Lambda, EMR, Step Functions, Glue, Lake Formation, CloudFormation/CDK)
* **Data & Streaming**: Apache Spark, Flink, Kafka, Kinesis, Airflow
* **Programming**: Java, Scala, Python, SQL
* **Databases & Storage**: DynamoDB, Redshift, PostgreSQL, Kudu, Hive

### 🚀 What I’m Exploring

I’m currently diving deeper into the AI ecosystem — exploring tools and infrastructure like vector databases, knowledge bases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. I’m especially intrigued by how data engineering principles intersect with modern AI to make information more searchable, contextual, and intelligent.

Beyond tech, I’m also on an ongoing journey to master personal finance — particularly stock and options trading — exploring how data-driven thinking in engineering can translate to better decisions in investing.

### 🏀 Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m usually chasing motion — on two wheels, a basketball court, or a running trail.
Biking through the Rockies around Boulder has a way of resetting everything — a perfect mix of adrenaline, altitude, and perspective.

When I’m not outdoors, you’ll find me in a different kind of arena — solving competitive coding problems, experimenting with new AI tools, or analyzing my latest stock trade setup.

I like to think of life as a continuous experiment — whether it’s optimizing an algorithm, fine-tuning a trading strategy, or simply finding the next thing that keeps me curious and moving forward.
