Hey there — I’m **Nithin Athrapulikkal (AP)** 👋

I’m a Software Engineer who loves turning complex data challenges into elegant, scalable systems. With over a decade of experience building data-intensive, distributed, and cloud-native platforms, I thrive at the intersection of big data engineering and system design.

Currently, I’m part of **Amazon’s Advertising Tech team**, where I design large-scale data processing systems for ads-measurement and privacy-first analytics systems that power insights across billions of ad events daily.
Before that, I built real-time streaming frameworks and AI-powered analytics tools at Alphonso (now LG Ads), Yodlee, Goldman Sachs and Infosys.

🧠 My Tech Stack

* Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, Lambda, EMR, Step Functions, Glue, Lakeformation, CloudFormation & more)
* Big Data & Streaming: Apache Spark, Flink, Kafka, Airflow
* Programming: Java, Scala, Python, SQL
* Databases: DynamoDB, Redshift, PostgreSQL, Kudu, Hive, MongoDB

🚀 What I’m Exploring

I’m currently diving deeper into the AI ecosystem — tools and infrastructures like Vector DBs, Knowledge Bases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. I’m fascinated by how data engineering principles meet modern AI to make knowledge more searchable, contextual, and useful.

I’m also on an ongoing journey to master personal finance, stock and options trading, exploring the parallels between data-driven decision-making in code and investing.

🏀 Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m usually chasing motion — on two wheels, a basketball court, or a running trail.
There’s something about biking through the Rockies around Boulder that resets everything — a perfect mix of adrenaline, altitude, and perspective.

When I’m not outdoors, I’m usually in my own version of the arena — tackling competitive coding problems, tinkering with new AI tools, or decoding my latest stock trade setup

I like to think of life as a constant experiment — whether it’s optimizing an algorithm, fine-tuning a trading strategy, or just discovering the next thing that keeps me curious and moving forward.
